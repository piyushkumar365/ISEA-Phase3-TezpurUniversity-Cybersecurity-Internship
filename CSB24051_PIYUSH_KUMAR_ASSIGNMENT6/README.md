GUI-Based Multi-Client Chat Application Using TCP

A GUI-based Multi-Client Chat Application developed using Python, Tkinter, and TCP Socket Programming. This project is an extension of Assignment 5, where the terminal-based client has been replaced with a graphical user interface while reusing the existing server implementation. The application supports multiple clients communicating simultaneously through a central server using reliable TCP connections.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a graphical desktop chat application by integrating socket programming, GUI development, and multithreading. The application provides an intuitive user interface for communication while maintaining the networking logic developed in the previous assignment.

The application supports:

Multi-client communication
Broadcast messaging
Private messaging
Online user management
Join and leave notifications
Chat history logging
Background message receiving
Responsive graphical interface
Software Requirements

Implementation Overview
The project follows a Client-Server Architecture using TCP sockets.

Server
The server is responsible for:

Accepting client connections
Managing connected users
Broadcasting messages
Delivering private messages
Maintaining online user list
Sending join/leave notifications
Logging chat history
The server uses multiple threads to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

Client GUI
The client is implemented using Tkinter.

The GUI contains:

Login Window
Chat Window
Scrollable Chat Area
Message Input Box
Send Button
Online User List
Disconnect Button
Connection Status Label
A background thread continuously receives incoming messages without blocking the GUI.

Execution Steps
Step 1
Start the server

python3 server.py
Step 2
Start Mininet

sudo mn --topo single,5
Step 3
Verify connectivity

pingall
Step 4
Open terminals

xterm h1 h2 h3 h4 h5
Step 5
Run the server

python3 server.py
Step 6
Run each client

python3 client_gui.py
Step 7
Enter usernames

Example

Alice
Bob
Charlie
David
Step 8
Start chatting

Broadcast

Hello Everyone
Private Message

/msg Bob Hello Bob
Step 9
Disconnect

Click

Disconnect

Conclusion
This project successfully converts a terminal-based TCP chat application into a graphical desktop application using Python Tkinter. The networking logic from Assignment 5 was reused with minimal modifications, while the client interface was redesigned to improve usability. The application supports multiple simultaneous users, broadcast and private messaging, online user management, and real-time communication using TCP sockets. Background threading ensures that the graphical interface remains responsive during message reception, and testing with Mininet and Wireshark verified the correctness and reliability of the implementation.
