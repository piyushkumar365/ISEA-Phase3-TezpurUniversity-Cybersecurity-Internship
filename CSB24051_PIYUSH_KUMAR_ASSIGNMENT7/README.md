Title: Secure Network Application Development Using TCP

# Objective
The objective of this assignment is to enhance the GUI-based multi-client TCP chat application developed in Assignment 06 by implementing practical application security mechanisms. The application provides secure user authentication, password hashing, duplicate login prevention, input validation, session management, and secure logging while maintaining reliable communication between multiple clients.

# Features Implemented
User Authentication
Username and password based login
Authentication before entering the chat room
Secure Password Storage
Passwords stored using SHA-256 hashing
No plaintext passwords stored
Duplicate Login Prevention
Prevents the same user from logging in from multiple devices simultaneously
Failed Login Protection
Blocks login temporarily after five consecutive failed attempts
Input Validation
Rejects empty usernames
Rejects empty passwords
Rejects oversized messages
Rejects invalid commands
Session Management
User logout support
Automatic session timeout after inactivity
Secure Logging
Login events
Logout events
Failed login attempts
Session timeout events
Invalid input attempts
Passwords are never logged
Chat Features
Multi-client communication
Broadcast messaging
Private messaging
Online users list
Previous message history
Software Requirements
Ubuntu Linux
Python 3.x
Mininet
Tkinter
Wireshark
Python Modules
socket
threading
tkinter
hashlib
json
csv
datetime
os
time
Network Topology

   Server   Client1  Client2
The application was tested using Mininet.

sudo mn --topo single,5
How to Run
Step 1
Start Mininet

sudo mn --topo single,5
Step 2
Open terminals

xterm h1
xterm h2
xterm h3
Step 3
Run Server

Inside h1

python3 server_multi.py
Step 4
Run Client

Inside h2

python3 client_gui.py
Repeat for additional clients.

Login Credentials
Example users stored inside users.json

Username	Password
admin	password123
alice	alice123
bob	bob123
Passwords are stored as SHA-256 hashes.

Supported Commands
Command	Description
/list	Show online users
/msg username message	Send private message
/stats	Display server statistics
/quit	Logout and disconnect
Security Features
SHA-256 Password Hashing
Authentication
Duplicate Login Prevention
Failed Login Protection
Session Timeout
Secure Logging
Input Validation
Password Protection
Thread-safe Client Management
Wireshark Verification
Capture network traffic using

tcp.port == 5000
The following were verified:

Successful Login
Failed Login
Authenticated Chat
Private Messaging
Logout
Testing
The application was tested for:

Multiple client connections
Successful authentication
Failed authentication
Duplicate login
Private messaging
Broadcast messaging
Session timeout
Logout
Invalid commands
Oversized messages
Secure logging
All tests were successfully completed.

Screenshots

Learning Outcomes
Through this assignment, the following concepts were learned:

TCP Socket Programming
Multi-threaded Server Development
Authentication and Authorization
Password Hashing using SHA-256
Session Management
Secure Logging
Input Validation
Network Packet Analysis using Wireshark
Client-Server Communication
Conclusion
This project successfully enhanced the TCP-based multi-client chat application by integrating practical security mechanisms. Features such as secure user authentication, SHA-256 password hashing, duplicate login prevention, failed login protection, session timeout, input validation, and secure logging significantly improved the application's security and reliability. Testing in a Mininet environment and verification using Wireshark confirmed that the implemented security features functioned correctly while maintaining stable communication between multiple clients. The assignment provided valuable practical experience in developing secure client-server applications and demonstrated the importance of implementing authentication, secure password handling, session management, and network security best practices.
